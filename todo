Dallas,Big City in Texas

Jekyll has a handy filter called inspect that you can throw onto the end of a variable to see what it contains.

{% assign city = site.data.cities[page.city] %}
{{ city | inspect }}
Which outputs nil.

To do what you want I believe you need to loop through the site.data.cities data file. Something like this works for me.

{% assign cities = site.data.cities %}

{% for city in cities %}

  {% if city.name == page.city %}
    <a rel="author"
      href="https://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }}"
      title="{{ city.description }}">
        {{ city.name }}
    </a>
  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}
